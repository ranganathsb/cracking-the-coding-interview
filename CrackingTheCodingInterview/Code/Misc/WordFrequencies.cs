    // This class computes the nth most occurring word(s) in a word document. It's been optimized to query multiple times over the same data
    // set. In the case where you're only interested in querying once there would be no reason to build the final dictionary and store it.
    //
    // The complexity of this algorithm is:
    // Time: O(w) + O(uw log uw) where w is the number of words and uw is the number of unique words
    // Space: O(uw) where uw is the number of unique words
    // I've separated the time complexity here because while the n log n sort of the unique words dominates the linear search through all of
    // the words in the worst case, in practical cases where processing large amounts of text in a given language (ex: a book) there are going
    // to be many repeated words and the ratio of the number of unique words to the number of words is going to grow logarithmically.
